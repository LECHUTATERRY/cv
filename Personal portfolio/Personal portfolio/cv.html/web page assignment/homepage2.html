    <h2>Machakos University</h2>
    <p>Machakos University was founded in 1957 as a Technical Rural Training School by the then colonial government. It was converted into Machakos Technical and Trade School in 1958, Machakos Technical School in 1967, and Machakos Technical Training Institute (MTTI) in 1987.

        MTTI was acknowledged for 
         a strong background in Engineering and Technology, Hospitality and Tourism.[4] The institution was upgraded to Machakos University College through Legal Notice No. 130, on 16 September 2011. The journey towards achieving a full University status started in earnest right at the inception.</p>
